    <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <span>Below you will find answers to frequently asked questions:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is public adjuster?</li>
          <p>Public adjuster is a licensed professional who negotiates first party property claims on behalf of policyholders. Public adjusters work for the “public” and are not directly employed by insurance companies.</p>
        <li>Why would I hire a public adjuster?</li>
          <p>Since we work for you and not the insurance company your interest to us comes first. Burden of proof is on you not the insurance company. Properly filed, presented and negotiated claim makes a world of a difference weather claim is paid or denied. Moreover when you file claim yourself you let insurance company decide what is covered and what is loss amount. Insurance adjusters are trained by insurance companies and adjust claims to their will not yours. We make sure that you are not taken advantage of and you get paid all that is allowed under the insurance policy and law.</p>
        <li>Why would I need help with the claim?</li>
          <p>Insurance claims are notoriously underpaid and frequently wrongly denied. You need professional to handle your claim just like you would need a doctor to treat you or lawyer to go to court for you. You will simply get better results and maximize settlement for your loss.</p>
        <li>Are public adjusters licensed professionals?</li>
          <p>Yes and depends on the state. Illinois requires us to be licensed and bonded.</p>
        <li>Why can’t my insurance agent handle the claim for me?</li>
          <p>Simply it is not their job. You have to be licensed professional to do and negotiate claims.</p>
        <li>How claim will affect my insurance premium?</li>
          <p>It depends on the type of the claim and loss amount. If you have several claims in short period of time it can also affect your premium. Typically if it is storm related claim (hail/wind) and no other claims filed in the past premium should not be affected however it is at the insurance company discretion. Premium can raise even if you have no claims at all.</p>
        <li>Can a contractor do or help me with a claim?</li>
          <p>You have to be licensed professional to do first party property claims. Contractors that offer free inspections and claim help simply violate state law.</p>
        <li>How public adjuster are compensated for services?</li>
          <p>Typically it is percentage fee of final negotiated and approved settlement. Percentage fee depends on type and complexity of claim. For example you can expect different fee percentage for hail claim and different for fire claim.</p>
        <li>Can claim be renegotiated once it is closed?</li>
          <p>Yes however there might be time limit imposed by the state law.</p>
        <li>Who can negotiate first party insurance claims?</li>
          <p>Insured, licensed attorney and licensed public adjuster.</p>
